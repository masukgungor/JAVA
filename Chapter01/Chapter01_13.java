/*(Algebra: solve 2 * 2 linear equations) You can use Cramer’s rule to solve the following
2 * 2 system of linear equation:
ax + by = e
cx + dy = f

x = ed - bf / ad - bc
y = af - ec / ad - bc

Write a program that solves the following equation and displays the value for x and y:
3.4x + 50.2y = 44.5
2.1x + .55y = 5.9
